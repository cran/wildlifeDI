#' @title Get period where two tracks overlap
#'
#' @description
#'   The function \code{GetTO} identifies and extracts fixes of a tracking dataset that overlap in time with all other trajectories.
#'
#' @details
#'   This function is used to determine the fixes that overlap in time between two trajectories.
#'
#' @param traj an object of the class \code{move2} which contains the time-stamped movement fixes of >= 1 individual. For more information on objects of this type see \code{help(mt_as_move2)}.
#' @param tb (optional) time threshold (i.e., time buffer) for considering if fixes are in the overlap period (in seconds).
#'
#' @return
#' A single \code{move2} object containing the fixes from traj that temporally overlap. If more than 2 individuals it will take the maximum of the earliest start-time from all individuals and minimum of the latest end-time of all individuals.
