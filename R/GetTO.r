#' @title Get period where two tracks overlap
#'
#' @description
#'   The function \code{GetTemporalOverlap} identifies and extracts parts of a trajectory that overlap in time with another trajectory.
#'
#' @details
#'   This function is used to determine the fixes that overlap in time between two trajectories.
#'
#' @param traj1 an object of the class \code{ltraj} which contains the time-stamped
#'    movement fixes of the first object. Note this object must be a \code{type II
#'    ltraj} object. For more information on objects of this type see \code{help(ltraj)}.
#' @param traj2 same as \code{traj1}.
#' @param tc time threshold for considering if fixes are in the overlap period.
#'
#' @return
#' A single ltraj object containing two bursts, representing the two original \code{ltraj} 
#' objects, each containing only those fixes that are overlap in time.
