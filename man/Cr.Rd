\title{Movement Correlation Coefficient}
\usage{
Cr(traj, traj2, tc = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{traj}{an object of the class \code{move2} which contains the time-stamped movement fixes of at least two individuals. For more information on objects of this type see \code{help(mt_as_move2)}.}

\item{traj2}{(optional) same as traj, but for the second group of individuals. See \code{checkTO}}

\item{tc}{time threshold for determining simultaneous fixes -- see function: \code{GetSimultaneous}.}
}
\value{
This function returns the Shirabe (2006) correlation statistic for two moving objects.
}
\description{
The function \code{Cr} computes the correlation statistic for movement data as presented 
  in the paper by Shirabe (2006). The statistic is essentially a Pearson product-moment 
  correlation statistic formulated for use with movement data.
}
\details{
The function \code{Cr} can be used to measure the level of dynamic interaction (termed correlation)
  between a pair of simultaneously moving objects. The statistic is sensitive to
  interaction in both movement direction (azimuth) and displacement, but is unable to
  disentangle the effects of these components. 
  NOTE: This function is only appropriate with projected coordinates.

data(deer)
#tc = 7.5 minutes
Cr(deer, tc = 7.5*60)
