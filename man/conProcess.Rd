\title{Process contacts}
\usage{
conProcess(mtraj1, mtraj2, dc = 0, tc = 0, idcol1 = "burst", idcol2)
}
\arguments{
\item{mtraj1}{an object of the class ltraj which contains the time-stamped movement fixes of the first group of individuals. Each individual should be stored with a unique 'id'. (see ?as.ltraj)}

\item{mtraj2}{(optional) same as mtraj1, but for the second group of individuals.}

\item{dc}{distance tolerance limit (in appropriate units) for defining when two fixes are spatially together.}

\item{tc}{time threshold for determining simultaneous fixes -- see function: GetSimultaneous.}

\item{idcol1}{column id associated with IDs of the first group of individuals, default is the 'burst'.}

\item{idcol2}{(optional) column id associated with IDs of the second group of individuals.}
}
\value{
This function returns the object mtraj1 with three additional fields:
contact - the number of contacts associated with each given fix.
contact_id - the id(s) of the individual(s) associated with those contacts.
contact_d - the distance (in the same units as mtraj1) at which the contacts occur.
Note that if more than one contact occurs at a given time, the contact_id and contact_d fields will be a concatenated list of the contact IDs and distances.
}
\description{
This function performs basic contact analysis between individuals in a group of tracked animals, or between two different groups of tracked animals.
}
\details{
This function can be used to identify the nature of contacts in space and time between individuals in one or two groups.
