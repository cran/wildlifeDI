\title{Dynamic interaction index}
\usage{
DI(traj, traj2, tc = 0, local = FALSE, rand = 0, alpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{traj}{an object of the class \code{move2} which contains the time-stamped movement fixes of at least two individuals. For more information on objects of this type see \code{help(mt_as_move2)}.}

\item{traj2}{(optional) same as traj, but for the second group of individuals. See \code{checkTO}}

\item{tc}{time threshold for determining simultaneous fixes -- see function: \code{GetSimultaneous}.}

\item{local}{logical value indicating whether a dataframe (\code{local = TRUE}) containing the DI index for each simultaneous fix should be returned (with a local permutation test), or (if \code{local = FALSE} - the default) the global index along with associated global permutation test.}

\item{rand}{number of permutations to use in the local permutation test.}

\item{alpha}{value for the \eqn{\alpha} parameter in the formula for di\eqn{_d} (default = 1).}
}
\value{
If \code{local=FALSE} (the default) DI returns the numeric value of the DI index (along with DI\eqn{_{theta}}{_theta} and DI\eqn{_d}), and the associated p-value from a permutation test (see \code{IAB}).
If \code{local=TRUE} DI returns a large dataframe that contains the localized \code{di} values as a column (see Long and Nelson 2013). The columns for \code{di}, \code{di.theta}, and \code{di.d} represent dynamic interaction overall, in direction (azimuth), and in displacement, respectively for each segment. A localized p-value for a one sided test for positive interaction (and z-score) is computed based on \code{rand} permutations of the segments. The row.name columns can be used to match the simultaneous segments to the original trajectory (see \code{IAB}).

\description{
The function \code{DI} measures dynamic interaction between two moving objects. It
calculates the local level di statistic for movement displacement, direction, 
and overall. DI can compute time- and/or distance-based weighting schemes
following Long and Nelson (2013).
}
\details{
This function can be used for calculating the dynamic interaction (DI) statistic 
as described in Long and Nelson (2013). The DI statistic can be used to measure 
the local level of dynamic interaction between two moving objects. Specifically, 
it measures dynamic interaction in movement direction and displacement.
