Description: Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal associations
    in the movements of two (or more) animals. This package provides tools for
    calculating a suite of indices used for quantifying dynamic interaction with
    wildlife telemetry data. For more information on each of the methods employed
    see the references within. The package (as of version 0.3) also has new tools for
    automating contact analysis in large tracking datasets. The package draws 
    heavily on the classes and methods developed in the 'adehabitat' packages.
