Description: Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal associations
    in the movements of two (or more) animals. This package provides tools for
    calculating a suite of indices used for quantifying dynamic interaction with
    wildlife telemetry data. For more information on each of the methods employed
    see the references within. The package (as of version >= 0.3) also has new tools for
    automating contact analysis in large tracking datasets. The package draws 
    heavily on the classes and methods developed in the 'adehabitat' packages.
